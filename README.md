## I. Data Visualization using Python
An overview of the various Python libraries used for visualization, using a climate change dataset as the running example.
If some of the plots in the Visualizing Climate Change.ipynb notebook are not rendered, there are a couple of ways to view the notebook:
- Open the notebook in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spryify/wwc-sv-ds-workshop/blob/f765194a48facec3c0f917634a847e5f3b55fb99/Visualization/Visualizing%20Climate%20Change.ipynb).
- Another option is to view an HTML version of the file. To do this, download the Visualizing Climate Change.html file and then open it in a browser.
